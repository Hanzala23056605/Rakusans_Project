The repository contains the main project details
P4. Interactive, real-time visualisation dashboard
Rakusens is a traditional food manufacturer based in Leeds that is actively aiming towards
modernising its processes via leveraging AI/Big Data technology. A key part of this includes
an interactive, real-time visualisation dashboard for monitoring/viewing temperature data
from a number of installed sensors. By using such a dashboard, operators will be more
proficient in adjusting production temperatures in order to produce better quality products
and increase energy efficiency, all in a manner driven by data insights.
This project offers a lot of modular development potential, some of the tasks that could be
tackled include the following:
• create an API for automatically retrieving and parsing SQL database records
• a 'responsive' web design, in order for the tool to be used ubiquitously on desktop
as well as tablets/mobile devices in a native manner
• add an authentication system allowing basic login functionality with abilities to
reset passwords
• provide interactive visualisations and statistics for data aggregated by sensor, by
using open-source libraries such as Plotly.js
• flag data points according to a 'traffic-light system' such that data points falling
outside of the general observed trend are indicated/colored accordingly. For this
task, a pre-developed Machine Learning model can be provided to the team in
order to perform the flagging.
• allow visualisations to be updated in real-time
